# Rust_ELMA ELMA running on Rust Language

Project Goals:
-- Create an ELMA project running On Rust Language
-- I will translate all the c++ code created for elma to rust
-- I will succeed if I am able to port the main parts of elma code to rust
  and the code compiles
-- I will use docker, and may need a rust compiler of some sort

Five Milestones:
1. Research what is needed to run a Rust Project 
2. Create a new docker for Rust project
3. Set up the docker to run Rust
4. Translate elma core code
5. Create unit test/ or create testing platform

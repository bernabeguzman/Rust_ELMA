# Rust_ELMA ELMA running on Rust Language

Project Goals:
-- Create an ELMA project running On Rust Language
-- I will translate all the c++ code created for elma to rust
-- I will succeed if I am able to port the main parts of elma code to rust
  and the code compiles
-- I will use docker, and may need a rust compiler of some sort

Five Milestones:
1. Research what is needed to run a Rust Project 
2. Create a new docker for Rust project
3. Set up the docker to run Rust
4. Translate elma core code
5. Create unit test/ or create testing platform

# HW_9 update
Finished step 1, and step 2 to research and create rust project using docker.
Next I will begin porting all the elma c++ code to rust and creat a test environment
What may be challenging is creating docs and tests for the rust language I will
have to learn what king of libraries are out there and how to used them. 


# Rust App In Docker
This repo is a simple example of how to package a Rust app in 
a Docker container and support ENV variables (like 12-factor app)

# Requirements
 * Docker environment and familiarity with command lines

# Setup
 * Clone this repo and `cd Elma_Rust`

# Build
`docker build -t my-rust-app .`

# Run (without ENV)
`docker run --rm --name rusty my-rust-app`
 * prints `Hello World`
